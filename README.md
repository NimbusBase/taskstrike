==========

This is a project management app built on top of NimbusBase. Because of this, there are a lot of code unrelated to NimbusBase functionalities itself. 

For those who want to look for working code on the more complex functionalities on NimbusBase:
1. Look at app/models/task.coffee for code on NimbusBase model creation
2. Look at controllers/application_setting.coffee for the sharing functionalities in action

NimbusBase integrated with the older version of Spine, but haven't been updated for the newer version.

A code cleanup with happen in the future for everything to be more read-friendly
